        What animal is white, furry and lives in Antarctica. Well, of course,
        it&CloseCurlyQuote;s the polar bear. Learn more about fascinating

      <h2 class="subheading">Appearance</h2>
      <p class="">
        Adult male polar bears weigh from 775 to 1300 lbs (350 to 590 kg), while
        females weigh from 330 to 650 lbs (150 to 295 kg). Did you know that
        Polar Bears don&CloseCurlyQuote;t actually have white fur!? Their fur is
        actually transparent and reflects light, making it seem white. Polar
        Bears don&CloseCurlyQuote;t have one but two layers of fat (aka.
        blubber), that helps keep them warm and for insulation, especially when
        swimming in icy waters. Having giant paws that measure up to 11.81 in
        (29.99 cm) across, makes it easier to walk on ice without slipping and
        also act as swimming paddles; The forepaws are the main paddles, while
        the rear paws are rudders. As well as large feet, Polar Bears also have
        anti-slip pads on their paws to help with slipping. On their paws they
        have thick, sharp and powerful, curved claws which are useful for
        getting a good grip on the ice and catching their prey. Short compacted
        tails help to prevent heat loss.

    <div id="habitat">
      <h2 class="subheading">Habitat</h2>
      <p class="">
        Polar Bears are found in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Russia and Norway
        (Svalbard). Climate change poses a large threat to Polar Bears, because
        ice provides a platform to hunt, mate, fish and just live in general.
        Sea ice also nourishes seals, which are the main prey to Polar Bears.
        Polar Bears will move within the area around their home. This area will
        vary depending on food and access to mating. Polar Bears will also
        undertake seasonal migration as necessary.

      <h2 class="subheading">Diet</h2>
      <p class="">
        They hunt seals, in particular they hunt ringed seals and bearded seals.
        Depending on their location they may also hunt hooded seals, ribbon
        seals or harp seals. Polar Bears have various different methods to hunt.
        Their first method is by finding holes in the ice and waiting for a seal
        to surface using its sense of smell. They may also watch sleeping seals
        and charge at them when the time is right. When springtime comes around,
        Polar Bear will break into seal lairs and catch the fatty pups. Polar
        Bears will usually prefer to scavenge other large mammal carcasses
        instead of doing it themselves. Some examples of those large mammals are
        walruses, whales or narwhals. If food is limited, they may eat rodents,
        fish or berries/foliage. If food really is limited, they may even eat
        human rubbish. An average sized Polar Bear requires around 4.4 lbs (2kg)
        of fat daily. A Polar Bear will eat the skin of a catch, along with the
        blubber first and then most of the meat, leaving the rest for
        scavengers.
