      <p class="">
        Lily was a fish who loved to play with her friends. Every day she'd
        splash around with them. Suddenly, one day, she saw something shiny
        floating in the ocean. She swam towards it to see what it was. It was
        hard and smooth. It was a plastic bottle! She felt sad and angry at the
        fact that people would throw plastic into the ocean.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        She gathered her friends and asked them to swim around and gather all of
        the rubbish they could find. They soon filled a big net and left it on
        the shore for humans to see their mistake and get them to fix it.
