        Swish, swish. Swish, swish<br />
        We paddled through the shiny, clear water as a cool breeze in the sun
        stole the hat right off my mum’s head. With a ringing in my ear and an
        ache in my arm, we paddled forward to a bridge while splashing my mother
        in the face. She took her phone out of her wet pockets and asked me to
        take a few photos. As we passed under the bridge, I gave the phone back
        to her and she held it in her hand. Suddenly a shiny, hook-like figure
        flew out of the sky blinding me. The next thing I knew I saw a bloody
        finger and a shocked look on my mother’s face. My mind quickly raced
        back to its senses and I realised what was wrong. My mother had lost her
        phone. I shook an angry look at the people fishing above. So much for a
        nice holiday trip!

        Fortunately, we went with a small party from our family, our first
        attempt was hopeless, we couldn’t find the phone or the shiny case
        anywhere. Later when we finished our lap and headed back. My mom offered
        us a prize for whoever found it. I was way too scared to dive in and
        look for it. But our cousin was up for the challenge and he actually
        found it. You’d probably think the phone would be broken but luckily it
        was perfectly fine, no rice needed. Sure, there was a tiny bit in the
        speakers but the phone still recovered. Even if it was broken it was
        still a relatively new phone and we still had the old one. If you were
        wondering if my mum’s finger was okay, it healed extremely quickly.
