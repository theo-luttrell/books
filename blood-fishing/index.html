<h1 class="title">Blood Fishing</h1>
<h1 class="subheading">By Theo Luttrell</h1><p>Swish, swish. Swish, swish<br>
We paddled through the shiny, clear water as a cool breeze in the sun stole the hat right off my mum&CloseCurlyQuote;s head. With a ringing in my ear and an ache in my arm, we paddled forward to a bridge while splashing my mother in the face. She took her phone out of her wet pockets and asked me to take a few photos. As we passed under the bridge, I gave the phone back to her and she held it in her hand. Suddenly a shiny, hook-like figure flew out of the sky blinding me. The next thing I knew I saw a bloody finger and a shocked look on my mother&CloseCurlyQuote;s face. My mind quickly raced back to its senses and I realised what was wrong. My mother had lost her phone. I shook an angry look at the people fishing above. So much for a nice holiday trip!

<p>Fortunately, we went with a small party from our family, our first attempt was hopeless, we couldn&CloseCurlyQuote;t find the phone or the shiny case anywhere. Later when we finished our lap and headed back. My mom offered us a prize for whoever found it. I was way too scared to dive in and look for it. But our cousin was up for the challenge and he actually found it. You&CloseCurlyQuote;d probably think the phone would be broken but luckily it was perfectly fine, no rice needed. Sure, there was a tiny bit in the speakers but the phone still recovered. Even if it was broken it was still a relatively new phone and we still had the old one. If you were wondering if my mum&CloseCurlyQuote;s finger was okay, it healed extremely quickly.</p>
