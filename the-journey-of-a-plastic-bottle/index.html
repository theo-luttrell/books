    <p class="">
      I am lying on a small alleyway on the filthy streets of Melbourne, I got
      dropped from a young kid's pocket.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Soon a heavy downpour started and slowly edged me towards a storm water
      drain. It was extremely miserable down in the drain because I was soaking
      wet. I slowly floated down the drain until I could see a ray of sunshine
      and there was a river outside the drain so I dropped down into there.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      I was lazily floating down the beautifully, crystal clear river, there are
      other plastic bottles that look like me. They must have been dropped like
      me but many of the bottles look older than mine but they still are intact.
      <br />
      “I don't want to mess up this nice river!” I muttered out loud to myself
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Eventually I end up in the ocean, the water looks nice and clear but soon
      the water turns a murky greenish colour. Finally after an amount of time
      that is too long to put into words, I start going around gigantic circle.
      Soon I can a humongous pile of trash that stretches much further than I
      can see. I feel the thickness of the water increase as the plastic gets
      more common. “I don’t want to get swept up in the mess!”I thought to
      myself.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      I wait for many years in that mound of garbage I can feel myself slowly
      decomposing but it still feels so slow that it would be thousands of years
      before I decompose. I feel so bored that I am up to wondering about what
      is the point of having a bottle cap is. After a few years I see a boat
      with giant net behind it. The boat is heading towards me! I get whooshed
      under the boat and caught up in the gigantic net trailing behind the boat.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      It’s very fun being caught up in the net because I got to see the whole
      ocean. After a few days could feel myself being lifted up into the sky and
      being lowered into the back of a huge semi truck. The engine revved to
      life and I quickly shot off onto the freeway.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      I got packed into a box with others just like me and I went to a shop. I
      got bought by another young kid and put in his pocket.
