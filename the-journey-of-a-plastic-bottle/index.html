			I am lying on a small alleyway on the filthy streets of Melbourne, I got
			dropped from a young kid's pocket.
		</p>

		<p class="">
			Soon a heavy downpour started and slowly edged me towards a storm water
			drain. It was extremely miserable down in the drain because I was soaking
			wet. I slowly floated down the drain until I could see a ray of sunshine
			and there was a river outside the drain so I dropped down into there.
		</p>

		<p class="">
			I was lazily floating down the beautifully, crystal clear river, there are
			other plastic bottles that look like me. They must have been dropped like
			me but many of the bottles look older than mine but they still are intact.
			<br />
			‚ÄúI don't want to mess up this nice river!‚Äù I muttered out loud to myself
