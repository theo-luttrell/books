      <p class="">A merciless king who kills all the despise</p>

      <h1 class="subheading">Chapter 1: Fitzgerald Primary</h1>
      <p class="">
        Fitzgerald Primary was one of the worst and most boring schools in
        Australia. Everything in the school was grey. The walls were grey, the
        uniforms were grey, even the students’ moods were grey! Our story begins
        in a year 6 class, specifically a year six boy who had no idea of the
        events to come in the next 48 hours.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        “Lunchtime everyone.” said the teacher, Mr. Crack, in a voice that
        sounded like a drone.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        At most schools lunchtime was a break from classes. A way to clear the
        mind. Fitzgerald Primary was not like most schools. The only food that
        the school allowed were cheese sandwiches with wholemeal bread. The
        students grumbled and ate in complete silence. That was Fitzgerald
        Primary in a nutcase. Boring classes, boring lunch, boring teachers.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        At the end of the day, Craig always walked home with an exaggerated
        slouch. Only one more year at that dump until he was off to high school.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        He turned onto his street. If only something interesting would happen to
        him. All he did all day was school, homework, dinner and sleep. It was
        the same cycle every day. On weekends, all he did was read. His parents
        didn’t believe in screens. Because of this, Craig was actually quite
        smart but there wasn’t an extended learning program at Fitzgerald
        Primary.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        He got out his house keys and jiggled them around in the keyhole until
        the front door swung open. Craig was always the first one home. Both of
        his parents worked into the evening and weren’t home until about 7pm.
        Craig sat down at his desk and got out his laptop. His english homework
        was a 1000 word essay on the importance of character development in
        Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Craig sighed. Did he really have to do this? He
        remembered the school motto. ‘Shut up and do it’. Craig started typing.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        He was about 150 words or so into the essay, when he heard a scraping
        and tapping noise coming from his wardrobe. Must be nothing, he thought
        and went back to his essay. But the noise continued and it became so
        annoying that he couldn’t think of what to write in his essay. He got up
        and opened the door to the wardrobe. Nothing. He stepped forward to have
        a closer look and fell.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subheading">Chapter 2: The Courtyard</h1>
      <p class="">
        Craig’s head throbbed with pain. He slowly opened his eyes. He saw the
        faint outline of someone staring down at him.
      </p>
      <p class="">“Oh good, you’re finally awake.”</p>
      <p class="">Craig jolted. A face stared down at him.</p>
      <p class="">“Don’t panic. You’re perfectly safe here.”</p>
      <p class="">
        Craig focused his eyes on the face in front of him. He looked like a 22
        year old male with spiky black hair and wearing a quiver of arrows
        strapped to his back.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        Questions flooded out of Craig like a tsunami,
        “WhoareyouwhereamIwhatwasinmywadrobethisplacelooksstupidam
        IreallysafeareyouamadscientistdoIhavesomekindofmindcontrol
        powerandyouwanttoharnessittotakecontroloftheuniverse?”
      </p>
      <p class="">“Slow down there buddy, I’m getting to it.”</p>
      <p class="">Craig listened.</p>
      <p class="">
        “Every year, one 12-year-old comes to this place we call the courtyard.
        The courtyard becomes a maze every night. Nobody knows how. Every 2nd
        day we try and solve the clues. In the maze every 100 metres or so there
        are padlocks on impenetrable doors. On the door is 1 clue about what the
        code is. If we fail a padlock more than 3 times then the scars, armoured
        unkillable demons armour, take 5 people and we try again. We have to
        communicate our thinking. But here’s the catch, if we make a single
        sound, the scars kill us instantly. Scars are armoured creatures that
        come up out of the ground. They hold flaming hot swords that can cut
        through your head off like a hot knife through butter. You talk, and
        they move faster than the speed of light and cut your head clean off.
        You kinda have to see it to believe it”
      </p>
      <p class="">
        The courtyard was split into 4 parts, the kitchen, the bunks, the
        weapons shed and the forest. The man (named Trent) seemed to be one of
        the nice ones. Because of the system, no two boys were the same age. The
        oldest person in the courtyard was an eagle eyed man named Hex aged 56.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        Trent gave Craig a bit of a tour and gave him some weapons. Craig
        pointed out that surely weapons would be useless if what he heard about
        the scars were true, but Trent said they were handy against pests and
        also good for getting food.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        Soon came the night and Craig was incredibly nervous. Trent had given
        him strict instructions to stay right behind him and not to say
        ANYTHING. The men of the courtyard sat around the fire eating dead eagle
        and rat meat. Craig had noticed that all of the people there were men.
        Ben, the 13 year old, seemed nice.
      </p>
      <p class="">
        “The first time in the maze is always difficult,” Ben had said in a
        thick Irish accent, “Just don’t talk and you’ll be fine.”
      </p>
      <p class="">
        Soon came bedtime. Craig was not only nervous, he was curious. How long
        would he be here? What about his life back home? Why him? This whole
        thing was totally weird. He still didn’t entirely believe it himself. He
        rolled over and drifted off to sleep.
      </p>
      <h1 class="subheading">Chapter 3: The Maze</h1>
      <p class="">
        Craig awoke to complete silence. He looked around and almost cried out
        in shock. The maze was huge. Ivy covered walls had grown out of the
        earth like pillars. Short grass covered the soft ground. Craig scanned
        the horizon and eventually located Trent. He jogged over to him and just
        managed to stop himself from saying hello. Trent put his finger to his
        mouth, indicating the importance of staying silent. He pointed his
        finger forward and the group of boys set off jogging into the maze.
