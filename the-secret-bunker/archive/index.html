        The Secret Bunker
    </h1>
    <a class="section-title" href="details/">(DETAILS)</a>   
        <p class="">It all started on a chilly Monday morning. The bell rang to go outside, a second later everyone spilled out of their classrooms. I ran to the other side of the school to greet my friends at the six-square court. I got there first, so I hugged myself to keep warm. Suddenly a warm breeze ran over me. I ignored it, it was probably just a coincidence. The rest of my friends ran over to me, Miles (my best friend) was holding his signature blue bouncy ball. We started playing six-square until someone consciously kicked our ball away. <br>
        "Hey, what was that for?!" I said. <br>
        I ran over to where the ball had landed and retrieved it. We continued playing. A few moments later he did it again. <br>
        "STOP!" I yelled. <br>
        A freezing gust of wind brushed over my face. The kid stopped moving. <br>
        "I didn…" I stammered and peered side to side, only me and my friends were moving. Even the basketball was perfectly preserved in the air. <br>
        "What the…" Miles started to say, <br>
        "... glowing?," Marshall, one of my other friends stammeredCautiously, Miles touched me. <br>
        "Ow, that's hot," retracting his arm and started wafting it around. <br>
        Just as soon as it started it healed. Something was going on. Burns don't heal that quickly. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        I wished I could go home already. <br>
        "Look up," Ragnar said. <br>
        Everyone looked up. The clouds were moving at supersonic speeds. The bell went multiple times. I checked my watch, it said 3:31. <br>
        "It's hometime." I said. <br>
        "I don't believe you," Ragnar said. <br>
        As he checked his watch his eyes grew 12 times their usual size. <br>
        In bewilderment, I sat down and started fiddling with my square. The fabric easily tore off.There was a door like something out of a zombie apocalypse movie, an underground bunker. There was some text embedded in the middle saying "PRO GAMERS ONLY". Under the text there was a keyhole. <br>
        "I wish I had a key," I muttered out loud. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        Suddenly I felt my pocket get heavier. I fished out a key and slid it into the hole. I twisted it with ease and it clicked open. The door fell open revealing a ladder leading to a well lit room underneath. <br>
        "Did you just…," Miles enquired. <br>
        "Yeah," I replied. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        I clambered in and my friends followed me. It had a faint smell of chocolate and mints. Inside the room were six desks with high tech computers, keyboards and mice. Under the computers there was a medium-large compartment that contained a PS5, a Nintendo Switch, an XBOX and a STEAM Deck. I'm glad I didn't set that up because there were heaps and heaps of cords, but it looked like someone had neatly strapped them together in neat little bundles. Under the compartment there was a smaller cupboard. I walked towards it and opened the cupboard. It contained millions of disks and chips for the consoles. To the right of the computers there was a gigantuan kitchen. I slightly opened one of the pantry doors and saw empty shelves. I closed the door and walked away wishing the door would be full of yummy snacks. <br>
        "This place has everything," Miles said. <br>
        I looked at my watch, 3:31, the time still hadn't moved. <br>
        "We can game as long as we want!" I exclaimed. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
        I peeked through the door behind the kitchen. There were six king sized beds, complete with all of our stuffed toys. I went back into the computer room and booted up one of the computers. It was seriously quick! Marshall walked towards the cupboard, opened it and poped a cheeto puff in his mouth. Miles put his ball in by the beds and started to sit down on the chair at one of the desks. <br>
        "What do you want to play?" I asked.
