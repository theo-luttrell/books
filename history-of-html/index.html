      Have you ever wanted to know how the internet took place? Well, today I
      will take you on a crash-course on the history of HTML (technically it's a
      markup language, not a coding language), one of the most popular coding
      language for web development. Jump right in!
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1993 Tim Berner-Lee published HTML with only support for basic text and
      hyperlinks. Despite it's basic functionality, it was revolutionary at the
      time because the simplicity ensured that it was quick to catch on. He
      originally started HTML as a science project at CERN (a research
      institute).
    </p>
    <p>
      Just 2 years later, HTML 2.0 was released, standardising the use of HTML
      and introducing forms and tables to support the rapidly growing community
      and the W3 (The World Wide Web).
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1997 HTML 3.2 was released adding applets, tables and improved text
      formatting such as<strong>bold text</strong>, <em>italics</em>,
      <u>underlines</u>, <del>strikethrough text</del>,
      <sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub>. Applets aren't currently
      supported in HTML5.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same year HTML 4 was published introducing scripting languages (like
      JavaScript) to add interactivity to the previously static web pages, but
      enough about that, this text is about HTML not JavaScript and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two years later they released HTML 4.01 providing a minor fix to HTML 4.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      4 years later development begins on HTML5, meanwhile, WHATWG takes over
      most areas that W3C previously controlled.
    </p>
    <p>
      2008, the first draft of HTML5 was published, which introduced new
      elements like article, section, navigation menus and headers for better
      SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and also expanding the viewport to
      support phones and iPads11 years later they introduced some new features
      in HTML, such as the dialog element which would be used for creating modal
      dialog boxes. W3C also announced that WHATWG would be the sole publisher
      of HTML updates, documentation and standards
    </p>
    <p>
      From 2020 to 2023 there were continued updates to the HTML Development
      Standard, enhancing pre-existing accessibility, additional new APIs
      (2020), more focus on exchange of information and performance throughout
      HTML (2021) and the importance of semantic HTML was emphasised to improve
      SEO and accessibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently HTML remains a foundation for most web development throughout
      the internet. Hope you enjoyed.
