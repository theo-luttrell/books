      Dear Diary, Today<br />
      I felt a bit sick in the stomach, there was a horrible, bright lightning
      storm and I slowly toppled right off my stump, it came with a horrendous
      ripping feeling that felt like it lasted for ages. Now I sit on the soft
      dirt of The Amazon Rainforest.

      Still lying on the ground. A beaver's curiosity took the better of it. It
      nibbled away at my toes, taking thin, slender logs out of my base, and
      scurrying away to its dam somewhere. Oh did I mention that it hurt, a lot.
    </p>

      A lumberjack found me lying on the ground, it was very awkward for me,
      since I'm a tree and cannot speak. I was trying to say that there was a
      squirrel family that had made a humongous mansion inside of me, but he
      just carried on and heaved me into the back of a truck.
    </p>

      The lumberjack drove me and some other logs to a gigantic, silver building
      that I'd never seen the likes of before. I was awake the whole journey
      feeling sorry for the family of squirrels living inside of me.
      <br />
      <br />They drove right into the building and carelessly unloaded all of
      the other logs, one by one and then finally me. I was dropped onto a big
      wooden crate onto the others. I'll miss that crate, he was nice.

      Today the people hastily loaded me into a debarker. I heard a click and I
      started to rotate, the top had a pointy bit (like a giant vegetable
      peeler) that ripped off my skin, yeowch. Feeling quite embarrassed (I'm
      naked you'd be embarrassed to) they yanked me out of the machine.
      <br />
      <br />Next they put me in a shredder. It put a burning sensation
      throughout my body, it was like being in a bushfire but without the burns.
      When I came out of the weird machine I felt extremely goopy.

      Tonight, I got to sleep on a cold wireframe bed, it wasn't very
      comfortable but considering all the things I had gone through it was
      "beddy" enough to get a nice sleep.
      <br />
      <br />When I woke up I felt really refreshed but I also felt as hard as a
      rock. They lifted me off my makeshift bed like I was a plank, I mean I
      sort of am, but that isn't the point. They squished me into two giant
      rollers that were going at supersonic speed. Directly after squeezing me
      in I bolted through them getting flattened. When I came out I felt dry and
      thin, but still quite rough.

      I got placed on a glowing red metal plate today, it was burning hot, like
      a bushfire but <strong><em>with</em></strong> the burns (heat burn, not
      charcoal burns). As I got lowered onto the plate I heard a lot of
      sizzling. I looked and saw hot bubbles of sizzling water. It made me feel
      smooth.
      <br />
      <br />They left me on the hotplate for several minutes. Soon after the
      heat turned off. A giant metal cutter fell down on me splitting me into
      neat sections. A wall squished me together into a neat stack of paper.

      I got packaged into a neat little package of paper. I got loaded into the
      back of a truck with some other paper packages. Remember crate, yeah I had
      a neat little chat with him on every step of the way.
      <br />
      <br />I got loaded onto a shelf in a supermarket. What an awesome place to
      take a nap. I thought. I woke up getting written on by a very sharp
      pencil.
