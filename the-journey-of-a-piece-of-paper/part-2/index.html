      I wake up and find myself at school being written on by a really sharp
      pencil. Ow oh god that stupid pencil . That reminds me of Brian the
      Branch. He always poked me with a stick. I wonder how he is.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      I try to shut my eyes again but I can’t sleep with a sharp pencil going in
      my spine every now and then. Finally about an hour later I got scrunched
      into a ball and seconds later I was flying like a bird.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      I hit the end of the bin and fell on the ground. It wasn’t comfortable but
      finally I could get some sleep.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Eventually I heard a bell ring and everyone went rushing out the door like
      feral animals. The teacher then shut off the lights, opened the window,
      put his headphones in and started nodding his head while singing. I think
      if the wind gets me I can get out the window.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Finally I was free and nothing could stop me. I flew past old buildings
      and Jails. I felt like a plane but then we crashed in a river
    </p>

    <p class="">
      When I looked up I could see Brian. I yelled up at him. Eventually, he
      fell down behind me for a ride in the river’s strong current
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Soon later, Brian and I got out into the dark ocean. We were both
      Petrified but we were happy just floating around in the ocean just the two
      of us.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Couple hours had gone by and Brian had spotted a green sea turtle. It was
      so cute. Unfortunately the turtle thought we were jellyfish and decided to
      munch us up.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      It was cool in a turtle but we weren’t moving and the heart wasn’t
      beeping. WE WERE STUCK IN A DEAD TURTLE.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      Finally, a Human decided to come save us. It was the same human that
      scrunched me up. He nicely carried Brian and I to his house and on his
      favourite shelf.
